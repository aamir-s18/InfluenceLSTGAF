# The Influence of Land Surface Temperature on Mental Health in Lausanne

This repo contains the code for the project ENV-444 Exploratory data analysis in environmental health at EPFL.

## Data
We have created the LST dataset by using [lstRetrieval.js](lstRetrieval.js). This has to be executed in [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/). The data extracted from Google Earth Engine is then cleaned and processed in [mergeClean.ipynb](mergeClean.ipynb). Please not that the health related data is not included in this repo, as it is not public. You can the final environmental data here.

## Analysis
The analysis is done mostly in GeoDa, please refer our for more details. The code for the statistical analysis is in [statistics.R](statistics.R).

## Visualization
The visualization is done in [figures.ipynb](figures.ipynb).
